Building libxml++-2.8 with Visual Studio .NET 2003

* You will need Visual Studio .NET 2003 (MSVC 7.1).  Earlier versions
of the compiler, including 6.0 and 7.0 will not work.  
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development Environment from the Glade
for Windows project, http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net.  
* Build libsigc++ 2.0.6 or later, and glibmm 2.4.7 or later from
source.   
* Add GTK+, libsigc++ and glibmm to the include and lib paths in
Visual Studio. 
* Load the MSVC_Net2003/libxml++.sln solution. 
* Build the entire solution.  Run the tests.
