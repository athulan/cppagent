/* config.h.in. 
   In config.h.in, define macros that are used at BUILD time. A good starting
   point is the file generated by autoheader. 
   On the opposite, macros useful to library users should be defined
   in libxml++config.h. Unlike config.h, libxml++config.h in installed
   in $(prefix)/lib/libxml++-2.6/include.

   Currently config.h.in is empty as no macro is used at build
   time. If, as an example, HAVE_STDLIB_H is used in one of the source
   files as a mean of detecting the availability of the <stdlib.h>
   file, proceed as follows:

   1. Add the following line to config.h.in

   #undef HAVE_STDLIB_H

   2. Add this text to the source file that checks for HAVE_STDLIB_H

   #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
   #include <config.h>
   #endif
